TransitMap
========

Where do people travel to work in NSW, and how do they get there? We visualise it. 

This code requires the following frameworks and libraries: 

* Kartograph (kartograph.org) including these JavaScript libraries:
    * jQuery (jquery.org);  
    * Raphael (raphaeljs.com),
* The jqPlot JavaScript charting library (jqplot.com).
 
Data sets included with this project are used under a CC-BY licence:

This project was the result of a collaboration between three people attending the 
Australian Govhack 2013 event, team "FUS RO DATA": 
* Hugh Saalmans 
* Edwin Dawson  
* Kelvin Tse
